                <p>The trend analysis shows the trends in the Usable Areas, Chargeable Areas, Space Functions and Costs for all the Organizational Units (Divisions, Departments, Cost Centers, etc). This option is available only to the Administrator.</p>
                <p>The trends are based on data from the Snapshots saved by the user. Snapshots can be taken periodically or whenever there is a significant change in space assignments.The trends in areas show the value on the Start Date (the Start Date selected by the user), Distribution Percentage for the Organizational Unit on this Date, value on the End Date (the End Date selected by the user), Distribution Percentage for the Organizational Unit on this Date, Average Sq. ft. for the selected period and Average Distribution percentage.</p>

                <p>To see the Trends or track changes in the spaces occupied by the Organizational Units (Divisions, Departments, Cost Centers etc.) in an Organization, users need to save Snapshots of data as and when changes happen. It should be a deliberate action taken by the user when he/she feels that a particular space change is significant.</p>
                <p>A Snapshot saved on a particular date, will have the Usable Areas, Chargeable Areas, Functional Areas and Costs of Space for all the Organizational Units. These values are in fact the corresponding values available in the Organizational Distribution Report on that date. Snapshots can be exported to select file format from the list.</p>
