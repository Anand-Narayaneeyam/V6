Different rates can be defined for each cost category. Typical Rates could be Normal, Special, Very Special, etc. For e.g. the Normal rate for Cat1 spaces could be $20 per sq ft, Special could be $15 and Very Special could be $10. Each Organizational Unit can then be assigned one of these rates for each Cost Category. For eg. Division1 can be assigned Normal rate for Cat1 spaces, Special rate for Cat2 spaces and Very Special rate for Cat3 spaces. Chargeback for Division1 will then be calculated on the basis of this.
