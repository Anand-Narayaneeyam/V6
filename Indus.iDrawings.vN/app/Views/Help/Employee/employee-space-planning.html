                <p>This option is for planning employee moves by creating Space Planning Projects and configuring space assignments visually using a space planning tool. Using this space planning tool, Occupancy and Vacancy details based on Employee Organizational Unitcan be viewed, modified and saved before executing the move. </p>
                <p>The Space Planning Project Manager can explore multiple options to plan the allocation of seats in the selected floors of a building and can try out moving organizational units from one floor to another in the stack plan. Once the move is finalized using stack plan, it can be approved and then converted to a move project. The move project can be directly executed or different seating scenarios can be created and one of them can be executed directly or through a Move Project Work Order.</p>
                <p>A Space Planning Project is to be defined first with a Project Name and details like Project Manager, Requester, Request Date, Expected Completion Date etc. Then the floors being considered for the planning are selected, and are added to this Space Planning Project.  Once the floors are selected, the Space Assignment can be viewed graphically as a Stack Plan through the Stack Plans option. </p>
                <p>Through the Stack Plans option, the Space Assignment (Occupancy and Vacancy) details based on the employee organizational units can be viewed, modified through Drag and Drop operations, and saved. Width of each organizational unit will be based on the percentage of total occupancy and limited to a minimum width (30 pixels).</p>
                <p>After making the required changes, click the Save button to save the plan. More than one Stack Plan can be created for a Space Planning Project. Only one Stack Plan can be approved for a Space Planning Project. The saved Stack Plan has to be approved before executing the move. Once it is approved it will be available in the Approved Stack Plans list. All the employees in the moved Organizational Unit will be added to the Move details with the source location as the floor from which it is moved and destination location as the floor to which it is moved. The move status of each employee will indicate with status Planned. After assigning move location to employees, it can be converted to a Move Project. </p>
                <p>A Scenario can be created if required, or the Move Project can be executed directly or through a Move Project Work Order. If a scenario is created, the seating can be further fine-tuned, and then the finalized plan can be executed. Once it is executed the Stack Plan Project status will be set to Executed.</p>
