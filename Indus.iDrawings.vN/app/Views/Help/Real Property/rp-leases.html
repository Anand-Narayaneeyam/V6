                <p><span class="header2">Direct Financing Lease:</span> Method used by lessors in capital leases when both of the following criteria for the lessor are satisfied: </p>
                <p>(1) Collectability of minimum lease payments is predictable and </p>
                <p>(2) No important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred. </p>
                <p>In a direct financing lease, the lessor is not a manufacturer or dealer; the lessor purchases the property only for the purpose of leasing it.</p>

                <p><span class="header2">Leveraged Lease:</span> Three-party lease contract under which a lessor borrows some or most of the funds to finance the asset to be leased to a lessee. </p>
                <p>In this arrangement,</p>
                <p>(1) financing provided by the lender is without recourse to the lessor, </p>
                <p>(2) the lender holds the title to the leased asset, and </p>
                <p>(3) the lessee's payments are assigned to the lender who can repossess the leased asset in case of a default. </p>
                <p>Leveraged leases are true (tax oriented) leases because the lessor enjoys all the tax benefits of ownership (such as depreciation) whereas the lessee can claim the full amount of lease payment as expenses.</p>

                <p><span class="header2">Sales Type Lease:</span> Accounting by lessor in which one or more of the four criteria required for a capital lease are met and both of the following criteria are satisfied:</p>
                <p>(1) collectability of minimum lease payments is predictable and </p>
                <p>(2) no important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred.</p>

                <p><span class="header2">Capital Lease:</span> A lease is considered to have the economic characteristics of asset ownership. A capital lease would be considered a purchased asset for accounting purposes.</p>
                <p>A lease falls into this category if any of the following requirements are met:</p>
                <p>1. If the lease life exceeds 75% of the life of the asset. </p>
                <p>2. If there is an option to purchase the asset at a "bargain price" at the end of the lease term.</p>
                <p>3. If there is a transfer of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term.</p>
                <p>4. If the present value of the lease payments, discounted at an appropriate discount rate, exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the asset.</p>

                <p><span class="header2">Operating Lease:</span> A contract that allows for the use of an asset, but does not convey rights of ownership of the asset. An operating lease is not capitalized; it is accounted for as a rental expense in what is known as "off balance sheet financing". For the lessor, the asset being leased is accounted for as an asset and is depreciated as such. Operating leases have tax incentives and do not result in assets or liabilities being recorded on the lessee's balance sheet, which can improve the lessee's financial ratios.</p>
                <p>If Lease Type is Direct Financing Lease, Sales Type Lease or Capital Lease, then a link <span class="header2">'Clauses'</span> will be visible to select the clauses based on the selected Lease Type. </p>
                <p>For leasing commercial buildings various Lease Categories are available. They are </p>

                <p><span class="header2">Gross Lease:</span> This lease category is also called the "Full Service Gross Lease" where the Landlord pays all of the operating expenses of the building (property taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, janitorial, etc.) for the duration of the term.</p>

                <p><span class="header2">Modified Gross Lease:</span> This lease category is also referred to as an "Industrial Gross Lease" where the Landlord pay for one or more of the operating expenses. There is no standard for which expenses are the Landlord’s responsibility. Landlord and Tenant can agree as to who pays for what.</p>

                <p><span class="header2">Net Lease:</span> In addition to rent, the Tenant pays for their pro rata share of operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and common area maintenance. In most cases, the Landlord is responsible for the roof, parking lot and possibly the foundation.</p>

                <p><span class="header2">Triple Net Lease:</span> This lease category is also known as "NNN Absolute" lease where the Tenant is not only responsible for the operating expenses as in a Net Lease, tenant is obligated to pay for all repairs to the property. The Landlord simply collects rent which, unlike a Gross Lease, represents the Landlord's net operating income. Net leases are very popular with single tenant retail and industrial users. In the Metro Boston market, this is the most popular type of lease.</p>

                <p><span class="header2">Percentage Lease:</span> This lease category is also known as "Shopping Center Lease". The Percentage Lease is additional rent due to the Landlord beyond just the base rent. The extra rent is based on sales over a specified amount, called the breakpoint. This type of lease used almost exclusively in retail settings of large shopping centers and malls. It is beneficial to both Tenant and Landlord because the Landlord has a financial stake in the success of the tenants which encourages owners to maintain the property and wisely choose a complementary mix of tenants.</p>
