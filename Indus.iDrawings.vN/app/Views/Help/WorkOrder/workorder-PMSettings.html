                <p>Master PM Schedules are templates for PM Schedules. PM General / Routes can make use of the Master PM Schedules while creating the schedules. On creating PM Schedules with Master PM, all the scheduling information (Equipment Category, Class, Recurrence Pattern or Meter Field details, Procedures etc) of the selected Master PM Schedule will be copied automatically to the new PM Schedule created. </p>
                <p>Master PM Schedule is not used for generating Work Orders as in other PM Schedules; instead it is used as a template for creating PM Schedules. By modifying Master PM Schedule, all the associated PM schedules can be changed.</p>
                <p>Master PM Schedule can be created as Time based PM Schedules. Time based Master PM Schedules are generally used for creating time based PM Schedules (General or Route), which can be used for generating Work Orders in scheduled Intervals (Daily, Weekly, Monthly or Yearly) using different Recurrence Patterns within each interval (Example: The First Monday of every month). </p>
                <p>Time based Master PM Schedules can be created by selecting Equipment Category, Equipment Class, Perform on, Recurrence Pattern and Seasons. Perform on combo box will be populated with 'Any Day', 'Working Day' and 'Nonworking day' options. By default Perform on combo box will be displayed with 'Any Day' option and Work Orders can be generated for any day regardless of the selected Calendar. If the 'Working Day' option is selected in the Perform on combo, Work Orders are generated only for Working Days else if Nonworking Day option is selected, Work Orders are generated only for Nonworking Days.</p>
                <p>Recurrence Pattern in the Add/Edit Schedule is provided with options - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly. 'Daily' option will be selected by default.

                <p>When selecting the Weekly option, all the Week days will be displayed with checkboxes. User can select any weekdays by checking its corresponding check boxes. For example, if PM Work Orders have to be generated on every Mondays and Wednesdays, User has to select Monday and Wednesday from the Weekdays listed.</p>
                <p>On selecting the Monthly/Yearly option, the corresponding details of the Monthly/Yearly option will be listed in which the user can select a particular day in a month/year. By default 'None' option will be selected for Monthly/Yearly option. For Example – if Monthly is selected, User can specify the particular day as Day 21 of a month or First Saturday in a Month. If Yearly is selected, the required day can be specified by providing 2nd March of every Year, or First Saturday in April etc.</p>
                <p>For Time based Schedules, any number of Procedures can be added.</p>

At a time, only one procedure will be applicable. The applicable procedure is identified by the sequence number. A sequence number assigned to one procedure cannot be assigned for another procedure.</p>
                <p>An Elevator has 3 procedures namely Monthly Procedure, Quarterly Procedure and Semi Annual Procedure to be executed. This can be done by creating a Monthly Schedule and by adding these procedures with sequence number as 1, 3 and 6 for Monthly, Quarterly and Semi Annual Procedures respectively. When generating work Orders with this Monthly Schedule for 6 months, the Work Orders will be generated based on this sequence in the order 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6. (If more than one procedure falls due on the same date, only the procedure with the higher sequence number will be selected. If 1 is also to be done with 3, the job steps of 1 should be included in 3). </p>

                <p>PM Schedules are predefined schedules for doing the scheduled preventive maintenance work. They are used to generate preventive maintenance work orders. A PM Schedule is defined for specific Equipment belonging to an Equipment Class. It specifies the PM procedure to be performed, the starting date and the frequency (Interval) with which it should be repeated. Seasons can also be specified for the Schedules.</p>
                <p>PM Schedules can be classified as PM Schedule (General) and PM Schedule (Routes). As the name indicates PM Schedule (Routes) is for Equipment grouped under a Route and PM Schedule (General) for any Equipment.</p>
                <p>PM Schedule can be created as Time based PM Schedules. Time based  PM Schedules are generally used for creating PM Schedules based on time (General or Route), which can be used for generating Work Orders in scheduled Intervals (Daily, Weekly, Monthly or Yearly) using different Recurrence Patterns within each interval (e.g. The First Monday of every month). </p>
                <p>Time based PM Schedules can be created by selecting Equipment Category, Equipment Class, Perform on and Recurrence Pattern. Perform on combo box will be populated with 'Any Day', 'Working Day' and 'Nonworking day' options. By default Perform on combo box will be displayed with 'Any Day' option and Work Orders can be generated for any day regardless of the selected Calendar. If the 'Working Day' option is selected in the Perform on combo, Work Orders are generated only for Working Days else if Nonworking Day option is selected, Work Orders are generated only for Nonworking Days.  </p>
                <p>Recurrence Pattern in the Add/Edit Schedule is provided with options - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly. 'Daily' option will be selected by default. As the name indicates, Daily option is for generating the PM Work Orders every day, Weekly option is for generating PM Work Orders weekly, Monthly option is for generating PM Work Orders monthly and Yearly option for generating PM Work Orders yearly.</p>
                <p>When selecting the Weekly option, all the Week days will be displayed with checkboxes. User can select any weekdays by checking its corresponding check boxes. For example, if PM Work Order has to be generated every Monday, User has to select Monday from the Weekdays listed. If PM has to be done two days a week, say every Monday and Thursday, then both days can be checked.</p>
                <p>On selecting the Monthly/Yearly option, the corresponding details of the Monthly/Yearly option will be listed in which the user can select a particular day in a month/year. By default 'None' option will be selected for Monthly/Yearly option. For example, if Monthly is selected, User can specify the particular day as Day 21 of a month or First Saturday in a Month. If Yearly is selected, the required day can be specified by providing 2nd March of every Year, or First Saturday in April etc. </p>
                <p>Date in Service field is used to calculate the Next PM Date based on the options provided in the Recurrence Pattern. Number of PM Work Orders generated with a schedule can be limited by selecting the required number in the 'End after' field or by selecting a particular Date from the 'End by' field in the Range of Recurrences.<br />Examples –</p>
                <p>For a Weekly PM Schedule, if the Date in Service is 12 Jun 2014 (Thursday) and Saturday is selected for PM, Weekly PMs will be scheduled on all Saturdays after one week from the Date in Service, i.e. starting from 21 Jun 2014. No PM will be scheduled for the first Saturday following the Date in Service, i.e. 14 June 2014 as one week has not elapsed from the Date in Service.  </p>
                <p>For a Monthly PM Schedule, if the Date in Service is 12 Jun 2014, and 'None' option is selected, Monthly PMs will be scheduled for the 12th of every month, starting from July. If a particular day is selected instead of None, say Day 16, the next PM date will be the 16th of the next month, provided one month has elapsed from the Date in Service. If not, it will be pushed to the 16th of the following month. If a month does not have the specified day, say 29, 30 or 31 in February, or 31 in April, June, September and November, it will be scheduled for the next day (or last day of the month). </p>
                <p>For a Yearly PM Schedule, if the Date in Service is 12 Jun 2014, and 'None' option is selected, Yearly PMs will be scheduled for the 12th June of every year, starting from 2015. If a particular day is selected instead of None, say Day 16 of June, the next PM date will be the 16th June of the next year, provided one year has elapsed from the Date in Service.
